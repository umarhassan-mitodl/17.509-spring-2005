Assignments
-----------

There are 3 written assignments for this course: one take-home essay, one in-class exam, and a final research paper. The take-home essay question asks students to consider the role of ideology in the motivations of and reactions to the civil rights movement.

The in-class exam is composed of 5 short answer questions (e.g. â€œAccording to Olson, why are small groups more effective than large groups in obtaining a collective good?) and one long essay question.

The topic of the final research paper (8-12 pages, double-spaced) is of the student's choosing, with approval from the instructor. The paper may examine a social movement not covered in the course materials or some aspect (theoretical or empirical) of the course materials, for example.
